# etch-a-sketch-

In this project I am creating basic version of Etch a Sketch. After loading the project user moves mouse around canvas and the squares over he hovers will change color to red, green or blue. On top of canvas you can find button to change width of canvas (limited to 100) to ensure there is no freeze or crash.
